# E-Voting using Blockchain

A simple E-voting Decentralised Web Application using the Ethereum Blockchain, Solidity and the MERN(MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, Node.js) stack


## Abstract:

Online voting is a trend that is gaining momentum and trend in modern society. It has great potential to decrease organisational costs and increase voter turnout. It eliminates the need to print ballot papers or open polling stations‚Äîvoters can vote from wherever there is an Internet connection. Despite these benefits, online voting solutions are viewed with a great deal of caution because they introduce new threats. A single vulnerability can lead to large-scale manipulations of votes. Electronic voting systems must be legitimate, accurate, safe, and convenient when used for elections. The main goal of this analysis was to examine the current status of blockchain-based voting research and online voting systems and any related difficulties to predict future developments. This study provides a conceptual description of the intended blockchain-based electronic voting application and an introduction to the fundamental structure and characteristics of the blockchain in connection to electronic voting. As a consequence of this study, it was discovered that blockchain systems may help solve some of the issues that now plague election systems. On the other hand, the most often mentioned issues in blockchain applications are privacy protection and transaction speed. For a sustainable blockchain-based electronic voting system, the security of remote participation must be viable, and for scalability, transaction speed must be addressed.

## Ethereum

For developing E-voting using Blockchain I used Ethereum - a popular platform for
creating distributed Blockchain applications that support smart contracts. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform

## Smart Contract

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts which contain the terms and conditions of
agreement between peers

They are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met

They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement or time loss

## Solidity

Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It is
statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among
other features

## Metamask

For performing any transaction on the blockchain we require an account which will have unique account address. This can be created by using the Metamask chrome extension

Metamask is a crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps. It generates passwords (in the
form of mnemonic )and keys on your device, so only you have access to your accounts and data. It helps users in interacting with the blockchain

## Ganache

Since working with the main ethereum network costs actual money for transactions, we are using a local RPC ‚ÄúGanache‚Äù.

Ganache is a local test network for rapid Ethereum and distributed application development.

It can be used across the entire development cycle; enabling us to develop, deploy, and test our dApps in a safe and deterministic environment.

It provides us 10 accounts each having 100 ethers for testing purpose.

## Web3

Web3. js is a collection of libraries that allow developers to interact with¬†a remote or local Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket. Using this library, you can develop websites or clients that interact with the blockchain.


## Truffle

Now to interact with our compiled smart contract in a hassle-free manner we use
Truffle suite.

Truffle is the most popular development framework for ethereum which makes
lots of work easier.

This generates an artifacts which plays an important role in the successful
deployment of our application.

It takes care of managing our contract artifacts so we don‚Äôt have to include support
for custom deployments, library linking etc.
